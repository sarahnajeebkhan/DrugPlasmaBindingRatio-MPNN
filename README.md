# DrugPlasmaBindingRatio-MPNN

The Drug-Plasma Protein Binding Ratio is an important element in the analysis of a Drug. Like most other industrial tasks, AI has attempted to replace the traditional methods of estimating the Plasma-Protein Binding (PPB) of a Drug. Although, AI has given good results, but the results have not been satisfactory enough to actually replace the traditional methods.

Here, Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) is used to train the model and the results are astonishingly good with a whooping 96.65% after 70 epochs.
